Description: A package for processing shotgun proteomics data to identify and
    infer proteins. The input consists of Peptide-to-Spectrum Matches (PSMs) 
    read from mzIdentML files using the mzR package. False positives are 
    controlled using various FDR estimations based on the target-decoy approach 
    and LPGF identification scores. Protein groups are formed using the 
    PAnalyzer algorithm.
