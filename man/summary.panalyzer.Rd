\title{Summarize PAnalyzer Results}
\usage{
\method{summary}{panalyzer}(panalyzer)
}
\arguments{
\item{panalyzer}{A data frame containing the results from the \code{panalyzer} function.
This data frame must contain the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{isDecoy}: Logical indicator of whether the protein is a decoy (\code{TRUE}) or a target (\code{FALSE}).
\item \code{proteinType}: The type of protein as classified by PAnalyzer (e.g., \code{"conclusive"}, \code{"indistinguishable"}, \code{"ambiguous"}, \code{"non-conclusive"}).
\item \code{proteinRef}: Protein reference identifier.
\item \code{groupRef}: Protein group reference.
}}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing the PAnalyzer results with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Type}: The type of protein (\code{"conclusive"}, \code{"indistinguishable"}, \code{"ambiguous"}, \code{"non-conclusive"}).
\item \code{TargetProteins}: The number of target proteins of the given type.
\item \code{DecoyProteins}: The number of decoy proteins of the given type.
\item \code{TargetGroups}: The number of target protein groups of the given type.
\item \code{DecoyGroups}: The number of decoy protein groups of the given type.
}
}
\description{
Provides a summary of the PAnalyzer results by grouping the data based on
whether a protein is a target or decoy, and by its protein type. The summary
includes the number of distinct proteins and protein groups for both target
and decoy entries.
