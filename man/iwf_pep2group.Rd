\title{Assign Peptides to Protein Groups}
\usage{
iwf_pep2group(pep2prot2group)
}
\arguments{
\item{pep2prot2group}{A data frame containing peptide-to-protein-to-group relations,
including \code{peptideRef}, \code{proteinRef}, \code{groupRef}, and \code{peptideType}.}
}
\value{
A data frame where peptides are assigned to protein groups, with additional columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{proteinCount}: The number of proteins in each group.
\item \code{proteinRefs}: A concatenation of all protein references in the group.
\item \code{proteinMaster}: The first protein of the group.
}
}
\description{
This function processes peptide-to-protein group relationships by summarizing
the number of discriminating and total peptides per protein, and then assigning
peptides to their respective protein groups. Proteins within a group are ordered
by the number of discriminating peptides, followed by the total number of peptides.

\code{\link{iwf_grouping}} for generating peptide-to-protein-to-group relations,
and \code{\link{panalyzer}} for protein grouping.
